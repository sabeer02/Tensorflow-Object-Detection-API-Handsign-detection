# Tensorflow-Object-Detection-API-Handsign-detection
This is a project where we will be using tensorflow object detection API to detect handisgn language and display the predicted output with the precision score


To collect dataset using OpenCv 
and to label the datsets you can use any softwares or applications, 
I used LabelImg.py, you can find those setup in youtube
And finally The main source code file is self-explanatory, 
I used google collab as an IDE
